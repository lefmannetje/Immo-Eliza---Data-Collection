# immoweb.be webscraper

## Descriptin
A simple webscraper using Python to scrape immoweb.be his listenings and saving them into a csv file.

## Installation
Simply run the `main.py` file and make sure you have installed all ncessary libraries for [requirements.txt](https://github.com/lefmannetje/Immo-Eliza---Data-Collection/blob/main/requirements.txt). 
If you want a clean scrape I recommend deleting `classified_ids.txt` so the program will make a new list of all the valid id's. The id's are beeing used to create a working ur for every listing on immoweb.be
